# Smoothie – Entities Data-Driven Tweening

Smoothie is a tweening library for ECS designed for expressiveness using a
data-driven paradigm. Every tween is an independent entity from the target, and
uses a type-agnostic binding system to call out fields within components to
tween, without requiring explicit code for tweening each component type (other
than adding the type to a `ComponentBroker`).

## Features

Smoothie is still in development, and offers no functionality at this time.
